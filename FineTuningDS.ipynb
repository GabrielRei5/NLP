Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the patient has a history of involuntary urine loss when she coughs or sneezes. That makes me think of stress urinary incontinence, which is common in women. But she doesn't leak at night, so it's probably not the kind of incontinence that happens mainly during sleep, like nocturia. Instead, it's more likely related to activities that put pressure on the bladder, like coughing or sneezing.\n\nShe underwent a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. I'm not super familiar with the Q-tip test, but I think it's used to assess urethral function. The Q-tip is a small device used to measure urethral resistance. If the resistance is low, it might indicate that the urethral sphincter isn't working well, which could contribute to incontinence.\n\nNow, thinking about cystometry. Cystometry is a diagnostic tool that measures bladder pressure and volume. It's usually done by filling the bladder and measuring how much it can hold before it leaks. It also records the contractions of the detrusor muscle, which is the muscle that normally holds the bladder in a state of urination.\n\nGiven that she has involuntary loss during activities that increase abdominal pressure, it's likely that her detrusor contractions are insufficient to prevent urine leakage. So during cystometry, the detrusor contractions might be weak or delayed. Additionally, her residual volume might be normal because she doesn't leak at night, suggesting that when the bladder is full, it doesn't automatically leak, so the residual volume is within normal limits.\n\nWait, but sometimes in stress incontinence, the issue isn't with the detrusor contractions but with the urethral sphincter. So maybe the detrusor contractions are normal, but the urethral resistance is low, causing the leakage. But since she doesn't leak at night, the issue is more about the urethral sphincter not closing properly during activities, not necessarily the detrusor contractions themselves.\n\nSo, the key here is that the detrusor contractions are normal, but the urethral function is compromised. Therefore, when the bladder is filled, the detrusor muscle contracts, but the urethral sphincter doesn't fully close, leading to leakage. But since her detrusor contractions are normal, the problem lies elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about what cystometry would show regarding residual volume and detrusor contractions. So, if her detrusor contractions are normal, then the residual volume would be normal too because she doesn't leak at night. But if the detrusor contractions are weak, then residual volume would be high.\n\nBut in her case, she doesn't leak at night, so her residual volume is probably within normal limits. Therefore, the detrusor contractions are normal, and the issue is elsewhere, like the urethral sphincter. So, the cystometry would show normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions, but maybe some other finding related to urethral function.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Stress urinary incontinence can be due to two main issues: either the detrusor muscle doesn't contract strongly enough (so the bladder doesn't empty completely, leading to residual urine) or the urethral sphincter doesn't close properly (so when there's an increase in pressure, like coughing, the urine leaks out). \n\nIn this patient, she doesn't have leakage at night, so the problem isn't the residual volume causing leakage when lying down. That suggests that the issue isn't with the detrusor contractions being too strong (which would cause her to leak at night) but rather with the urethral sphincter not closing during activities.\n\nTherefore, during cystometry, the residual volume would be normal because she doesn't have significant residual urine (since she doesn't leak at night). The detrusor contractions would be normal because the problem isn't with the muscle contractions but with the sphincter. So the key finding would be that the detrusor contractions are normal, and the urethral resistance is low.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks about residual volume and detrusor contractions. So if the detrusor contractions are normal, then residual volume is normal. But sometimes, in stress incontinence, the detrusor contractions are normal, but the issue is elsewhere.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the cystometry would show normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions, but the urethral sphincter function would be impaired, leading to the leakage during activities.\n\nBut the question is specifically about what cystometry would reveal regarding residual volume and detrusor contractions. So the answer is that both are normal.\n</think>\n\nThe cystometry findings for this 61-year-old woman would reveal normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions. The detrusor contractions are normal because the issue causing her involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing is not related to weak detrusor muscle contractions but rather to impaired urethral sphincter function. Therefore, the detrusor contractions are normal, and the residual volume is within normal limits as she does not experience leakage at night.\n\n**Answer:**  \nCystometry would show normal residual volume and normal detrusor contractions.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \nPlease answer the following medical question. \n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-09T04:40:34.668324Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-09T04:40:34.668920Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-09T04:40:34.674336Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-09T04:40:34.668892Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-09T04:40:34.673632Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"EOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token  # Must add EOS_TOKEN\n\n\ndef formatting_prompts_func(examples):\n    inputs = examples[\"Question\"]\n    cots = examples[\"Complex_CoT\"]\n    outputs = examples[\"Response\"]\n    texts = []\n    for input, cot, output in zip(inputs, cots, outputs):\n        text = train_prompt_style.format(input, cot, output) + EOS_TOKEN\n        texts.append(text)\n    return {\n        \"text\": texts,\n    }","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-09T04:40:40.090619Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-09T04:40:40.091180Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-09T04:40:40.097300Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-09T04:40:40.091157Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-09T04:40:40.096509Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\",\"en\", split = \"train[0:500]\",trust_remote_code=True)\ndataset = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True,)\ndataset[\"text\"][0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-09T04:40:43.720031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-09T04:40:43.720311Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-09T04:40:46.365776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-09T04:40:43.720292Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-09T04:40:46.364933Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md:   0%|          | 0.00/1.97k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"350eb7bd693e42b3a28ed2df1cbb9090"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/58.2M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"0217e64f7707458390a7d436a1b47d89"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/19704 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"ce14d9470bc74c21a22a20992a0d1519"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"f6f85cf3771345269f6f6ab87d978aa5"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":13,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \\nPlease answer the following medical question. \\n\\n### Question:\\nGiven the symptoms of sudden weakness in the left arm and leg, recent long-distance travel, and the presence of swollen and tender right lower leg, what specific cardiac abnormality is most likely to be found upon further evaluation that could explain these findings?\\n\\n### Response:\\n<think>\\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. We've got sudden weakness in the person's left arm and leg - and that screams something neuro-related, maybe a stroke?\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. The right lower leg is swollen and tender, which is like waving a big flag for deep vein thrombosis, especially after a long flight or sitting around a lot.\\n\\nSo, now I'm thinking, how could a clot in the leg end up causing issues like weakness or stroke symptoms?\\n\\nOh, right! There's this thing called a paradoxical embolism. It can happen if there's some kind of short circuit in the heart - like a hole that shouldn't be there.\\n\\nLet's put this together: if a blood clot from the leg somehow travels to the left side of the heart, it could shoot off to the brain and cause that sudden weakness by blocking blood flow there.\\n\\nHmm, but how would the clot get from the right side of the heart to the left without going through the lungs and getting filtered out?\\n\\nHere's where our cardiac anomaly comes in: a patent foramen ovale or PFO. That's like a sneaky little shortcut in the heart between the right and left atria.\\n\\nAnd it's actually pretty common, found in about a quarter of adults, which definitely makes it the top suspect here.\\n\\nSo with all these pieces - long travel, leg clot, sudden weakness - a PFO fits the bill perfectly, letting a clot cross over and cause all this.\\n\\nEverything fits together pretty neatly, so I'd bet PFO is the heart issue waiting to be discovered. Yeah, that really clicks into place!\\n</think>\\nThe specific cardiac abnormality most likely to be found in this scenario is a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg. The connection between the recent travel, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and the neurological symptoms suggests the presence of a PFO facilitating a paradoxical embolism.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r=16,  \n    target_modules=[\n        \"q_proj\",\n        \"k_proj\",\n        \"v_proj\",\n        \"o_proj\",\n        \"gate_proj\",\n        \"up_proj\",\n        \"down_proj\",\n    ],\n    lora_alpha=16,\n    lora_dropout=0,  \n    bias=\"none\",  \n    use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\",  # True or \"unsloth\" for very long context\n    random_state=3407,\n    use_rslora=False,  \n    loftq_config=None,\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-09T04:40:51.591216Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-09T04:40:51.591875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-09T04:40:58.978370Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-09T04:40:51.591851Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-09T04:40:58.977779Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.6.1 patched 32 layers with 32 QKV layers, 32 O layers and 32 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from trl import SFTTrainer\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments\nfrom unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported\n\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n    train_dataset=dataset,\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,\n    dataset_num_proc=2,\n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,\n        # Use num_train_epochs = 1, warmup_ratio for full training runs!\n        warmup_steps=5,\n        max_steps=60,\n        learning_rate=2e-4,\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),\n        logging_steps=10,\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",\n        weight_decay=0.01,\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",\n        seed=3407,\n        output_dir=\"outputs\",\n    ),\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-09T04:41:07.705094Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-09T04:41:07.705680Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-09T04:41:08.840363Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-09T04:41:07.705657Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-09T04:41:08.839659Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Unsloth: Tokenizing [\"text\"]:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e4998250068049ad9caa1c68c9e5c7ee"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":"trainer_stats = trainer.train()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-09T04:41:14.068732Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-09T04:41:14.069490Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-09T05:22:38.637284Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-09T04:41:14.069440Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-09T05:22:38.636759Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"==((====))==  Unsloth - 2x faster free finetuning | Num GPUs used = 1\n   \\\\   /|    Num examples = 500 | Num Epochs = 1 | Total steps = 60\nO^O/ \\_/ \\    Batch size per device = 2 | Gradient accumulation steps = 4\n\\        /    Data Parallel GPUs = 1 | Total batch size (2 x 4 x 1) = 8\n \"-____-\"     Trainable parameters = 41,943,040/8,000,000,000 (0.52% trained)\n\u001b[34m\u001b[1mwandb\u001b[0m: \u001b[33mWARNING\u001b[0m The `run_name` is currently set to the same value as `TrainingArguments.output_dir`.

She's a 61-year-old woman with a history of losing urine involuntarily during things like coughing or sneezing but not at night. That's interesting. It sounds like she's dealing with some kind of urinary incontinence, but it's not the usual kind.\n\nWhen you think about this, it makes me think of something called 'stress urinary incontinence.' That's where you lose urine because of activities that put pressure on the bladder, like coughing or sneezing. That fits what she's been experiencing.\n\nNow, she's had a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I'm not too familiar with the Q-tip test, but I know it's often used to assess for urethral obstruction. It's like a physical test where they check how the urethra is functioning by using a catheter.\n\nIf she's had a gynecological exam, they probably checked her bladder and urethra too. These exams are often done to figure out why there's such a specific kind of incontinence.\n\nNow, thinking about what happens in stress incontinence, I recall that the bladder capacity can vary. Sometimes people have what's called 'decreased bladder capacity' or 'increased residual volume.' If her bladder can't hold as much as it should, it could lead to more frequent urination.\n\nBut wait, stress incontinence is more about the urethral resistance or the ability to hold the urine against pressure. So, in this case, it's more about the urethral function than the bladder's capacity.\n\nI'm trying to remember what happens in stress incontinence. I think that people with stress incontinence tend to have normal bladder capacity and normal residual volume. It's the ability to hold the pressure that's the issue.\n\nSo, if her bladder capacity is normal, her residual volume shouldn't be high. It's more about how well her urethra can resist the pressure.\n\nIf she's experiencing stress incontinence, her residual volume would likely be normal, and her detrusor contractions should also be normal. It's more about how well her urethra can handle the pressure from the bladder.\n\nYeah, that seems to fit. So, putting it all together, if she has stress incontinence, her cystometry would probably show that her residual volume is normal and her detrusor contractions are normal too.\n</think>\nBased on the provided information, the 61-year-old woman is experiencing stress urinary incontinence, characterized by involuntary urine loss during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing or sneezing. Stress urinary incontinence typically involves a functional issue with the urethral resistance rather than a problem with bladder capacity or residual volume.\n\nWhen considering the findings from a gynecological exam and the Q-tip test, which assesses urethral function, we can infer that her urethral resistance is normal. This is because stress incontinence is not primarily caused by an inability to hold the urine due to insufficient bladder capacity or increased residual volume. Instead, it is about the urethral muscles failing to adequately resist the pressure from the bladder during these activities.\n\nGiven her history and the typical presentation of stress incontinence, her cystometry would likely reveal that her residual volume and detrusor contractions are within the normal range. The primary issue lies in the urethral resistance, not in the bladder capacity or residual volume.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17}]}
